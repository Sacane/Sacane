<h1 align="center"> Sacane</h1>

I'm a French developer with a strong passion for coding, holding a Master's degree from Gustave Eiffel University. I'm committed to expanding my knowledge in computer science, especially in development.

Additionally, I'm a pianist with a love for jazz, gospel, and alternative rock.


<h1 align="center">About me as developper</h1>

My primary expertise in development revolves entirely around the Java Virtual Machine, including the Java language. You can be sure that I always stay updated with the latest changes for each new version. Additionally, I am deeply learning the Kotlin language, which might be the one I enjoy developing with the most.
