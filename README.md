I'm just a french and very passionated developper, having a Master degree from the Gustave Eiffel University. Trying my best to learn more about computing science, specially about developpment. 

I'm also a pianist, loving jazz, gospel and alternative rock.


<h1 align="center">About me as developper</h1>

My primary expertise in development revolves entirely around the Java Virtual Machine, including the Java language. You can be sure that I always stay updated with the latest changes for each new version. Additionally, I am deeply learning the Kotlin language, which might be the one I enjoy developing with the most.
